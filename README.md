# How Does WordPress Divi Work?
WordPress’ Divi Builder works through a system of content blocks and modules. Content blocks can be added, removed and edited freely and lets users – even those without design or development experience – to create a virtually unlimited number of layout styles.

Divi Builder Modules are a separate section and are made to help simplify the design process by allowing WordPress users to drag and drop different components of their WordPress website to create the layout and style they want.

Overall, with just a basic overview, Divi Builder is a very intuitive and user friendly system. Once you start using it to create, you’ll wonder how you ever worked without it. There are certainly other WordPress “Builder” systems out there that bolt onto the WordPress administrative area, but all of them tend to follow a similar path in terms of dragging and dropping various elements and then filling those out according to your design goals and vision.

# Is WordPress Divi Just for Beginners?
Absolutely not. In fact, WordPress developers and WordPress professionals like using Divi Builder as well because of its contextual settings and ease of editing. One single right click opens up a plethora of options that are designed to speed up workflow while allowing for detailed customization of every aspect of a website’s design and structure.

The true beauty and breadth of the WordPress Divi Builder lies in its content modules. Want to insert a video into your WordPress site? Drag and drop. Want to insert a contact form? Drag and drop. Want to set up shop on your WordPress website and start selling products online? Drag and drop. There are dozens of different content options, and if for some reason your imagined option isn’t available, you can freely customize the CSS within Divi Builder’s Code Module if you have experience with web design or development.

Made a mistake? No problem. Divi Builder comes with unlimited undo and redo options so you can always go back to a prior version if you want. If you’re creating a Divi-based site for someone else, you can lock individual elements so they can’t mess up your hard work.
